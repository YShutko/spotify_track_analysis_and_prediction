# Spotify Track Analytics

Analyze ~114k Spotify tracks to understand what drives popularity, explore mood/genre patterns, and prototype lightweight prediction tools for playlist building or A&R triage.

## SPOTIFY POPULARITY PREDICTOR (GRADIO DEMO)

Gradio on local host: Running on local [URL](http://127.0.0.1:7865)

## Business Problems and Goals
- What audio and metadata signals most influence a track’s popularity score (0–100)?
- Can we quickly triage large catalogs to surface likely hits or candidate tracks for playlists?
- How do energy/valence/danceability differ by macro-genre, and where are outliers worth A&R follow-up?
- Deliver simple, reproducible tooling (notebook widgets + Gradio demo) that product or data teams can test with minimal setup.

## Data
- Source: [Kaggle – Spotify Tracks Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maharshipandya/-spotify-tracks-dataset)
- Files: [raw data](https://github.com/YShutko/CI_spotify_track_analysis/blob/3c1d5b469e04c4a46cf01e3d99477fac8d672044/data/spotify_dataset.csv) (raw, ~20 MB) and [cleaned dataset](https://github.com/YShutko/CI_spotify_track_analysis/blob/3c1d5b469e04c4a46cf01e3d99477fac8d672044/data/spotify_cleaned_data.csv) (preprocessed subset used in all notebooks).
- The dataset consists of the following columns:
* track_id: Unique Spotify identifier for each track.
* artists: List of artists performing the track, separated by semicolons.
* album_name: Title of the album where the track appears.
* track_name: Title of the song.
* popularity: Score from 0–100 based on recent play counts; higher means more popular.
* duration_ms: Length of the track in milliseconds.
* explicit: Indicates whether the track contains explicit content (True/False).
* danceability: Score (0.0–1.0) measuring how suitable the song is for dancing.
* energy: Score (0.0–1.0) reflecting intensity, speed, and loudness.
* key: Musical key using Pitch Class notation (0 = C, 1 = C♯/D♭, etc.).
* loudness: Overall volume of the track in decibels.
* mode: Indicates scale type (1 = major, 0 = minor).
* speechiness: Score estimating spoken content in the track.
* cousticness: Likelihood (0.0–1.0) that the song is acoustic.
* instrumentalness: Probability that the track has no vocals.
* liveness: Measures if the song was recorded live (higher = more live).
* valence: Positivity of the music (0.0 = sad, 1.0 = happy).
* tempo: Speed of the song in beats per minute (BPM).
time_signature: Musical meter (e.g. 4 = 4/4 time).
track_genre: Musical genre classification of the track.

- [ml_models.ipynb](https://github.com/YShutko/CI_spotify_track_analysis/blob/3c1d5b469e04c4a46cf01e3d99477fac8d672044/notebooks/ml_models.ipynb) – Feature engineering and model training for popularity prediction.

- [gradio.ipynb](https://github.com/YShutko/CI_spotify_track_analysis/blob/3c1d5b469e04c4a46cf01e3d99477fac8d672044/models_widgets/gradio.ipynb) – Gradio UI for quick web demos (multiple downloadable models).
- [flagged](https://github.com/YShutko/CI_spotify_track_analysis/blob/3c1d5b469e04c4a46cf01e3d99477fac8d672044/models_widgets/.gradio/flagged/dataset1.csv) – Sample flagged input from a previous Gradio run.

## Models and Comparison (from [ml_models.ipynb](https://github.com/YShutko/CI_spotify_track_analysis/blob/3c1d5b469e04c4a46cf01e3d99477fac8d672044/notebooks/ml_models.ipynb))
- Linear Regression baseline: MAE 14.17, RMSE 19.32, R² 0.252 — weak fit, high error.
- Random Forest (300 trees): MAE 4.86, RMSE 9.98, R² 0.801 — strongest performer in this run.
- XGBoost (untuned): MAE 5.92, RMSE 11.03, R² 0.756 — good, but behind RF.
- XGBoost (tuned): MAE 5.11, RMSE 9.99, R² 0.800 — closes the gap with RF after tuning.
- Takeaway: tree ensembles give the best accuracy; tuning XGB nearly matches RF while offering faster inference knobs for deployment.

## Interactive Prediction Tools
- **Notebook widget ([ipywidgets.ipynb](https://github.com/YShutko/CI_spotify_track_analysis/blob/3c1d5b469e04c4a46cf01e3d99477fac8d672044/models_widgets/ipywidgets.ipynb))**  
  Downloads a selected model from the Hugging Face repo `YShutko/spotify-popularity-models`, loads macro-genre options from the cleaned data, and exposes sliders/dropdowns to test popularity predictions inline.
- **Gradio app ([gradio.ipynb](https://github.com/YShutko/CI_spotify_track_analysis/blob/3c1d5b469e04c4a46cf01e3d99477fac8d672044/models_widgets/gradio.ipynb))**  
  Loads multiple Hugging Face models and builds a Gradio UI with sliders and a genre dropdown. Use it to share a quick web demo; Gradio handles launching and optional sharing links. (Note: Ensure the selected model is passed through in the predict function before production use.)

## Suggested Workflow
1) Use `data/spotify_cleaned_data.csv` to skip heavy preprocessing.
2) Run `notebooks/Spotify_track_analysis.ipynb` to explore distributions, correlations, and genre-level mood/energy patterns.
3) Train and compare models in `notebooks/ml_models.ipynb`; focus on RF vs tuned XGB.
4) Demo predictions with the ipywidgets notebook or the Gradio app for stakeholder feedback.

## Conclusion
- Popularity is predictable with tree-based models using standard audio features; RF and tuned XGB achieve MAE ≈ 5–5.1 and R² ≈ 0.80 on this dataset.
- Macro-genre and energy/valence interactions remain useful signals for triage; additional metadata (artist history, release timing) could further reduce error.
- The Gradio and notebook widgets provide fast, shareable prototypes for product or A&R teams; harden by validating model selection wiring and adding input validation if deploying beyond experiments.
